# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- Collapse adjacent successful tool calls into one compact block per tool type, each with a gear header and bulleted call summaries.
- Add vertical spacing between tool types and a hanging indent for wrapped bullet summaries.
- Keep visible thinking/text, active calls, and errors as group boundaries; expand errors in place.
- Combine only directly adjacent thinking blocks, falling back to Pi's renderer exactly once on malformed content.
- Restore individual full blocks when tools are expanded (Ctrl+O).
